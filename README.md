# A Framework for Treating Large Language Models as Communication Channels: Implications for Intelligence and Evolution

## Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in natural language processing, but their performance is heavily reliant on the quality of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective: viewing LLMs as communication channels, with correct training data as the signal and all other data as noise. Leveraging concepts from information theory, we analyze the reliability and throughput of this communication channel, establishing its upper bound as a measure of the model's intelligence. We identify sources of delay, including training time and data acquisition, which influence the rate of the system's intelligence evolution. Our framework aims to provide a general approach for characterizing LLMs as communication channels and defining system intelligence as information transmission. Additionally, we explore intriguing questions such as underfitting, overfitting, and the predictive power of LLMs in forecasting human intelligence evolution.

## Introduction:
The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, but their performance is intricately tied to the quality of training data. We propose a paradigm shift: treating LLMs as communication channels, where data serves as the medium of transmission. Drawing from information theory, we seek to quantify the intelligence of LLMs based on their ability to effectively transmit information.

## Modeling LLMs as Communication Channels:
In our framework, correct training data acts as the signal, conveying meaningful linguistic patterns, while extraneous data serves as noise, introducing distortions. The transformer architecture functions as the encoding and decoding mechanism, transforming input data into coherent output responses. Through this lens, the intelligence of an LLM can be quantified by its capacity to accurately transmit and decode information, akin to the reliability and throughput of a communication channel.

## Factors Influencing Intelligence Evolution:
The delay inherent in the LLM communication channel stems from various sources, including the time required for training, model updating, and acquiring new training data. This delay fundamentally shapes the rate at which the intelligence of the system evolves, underscoring the importance of efficient data acquisition and processing strategies.

## Exploring Fundamental Questions:
Our framework raises intriguing questions regarding the underfitting and overfitting conditions of LLMs. Underfitting may occur when there is insufficient high-quality data in the training set, leading to suboptimal model performance. Conversely, overfitting may arise from an abundance of biased training data, skewing the intelligence of the system towards specific patterns or biases. Moreover, we propose investigating the predictive power of LLMs in anticipating the evolution of human intelligence.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, we advocate for a paradigm shift in understanding LLMs as communication channels, with their intelligence defined by the effective transmission of information. Our framework offers a novel perspective for analyzing LLM performance and evolution, highlighting the critical role of high-quality data and efficient data processing techniques. By addressing fundamental questions and exploring new avenues of research, we can unlock deeper insights into the capabilities and potential of large language models in shaping human understanding and intelligence evolution.
